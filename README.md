# FSR_HuzzahShield

The goal of the project is to analyze a persons sitting posture over time & give immediate feedback if the user has been sitting too long, or has adapted a bad sitting position.

To do this we connect a 4x4 Force Sensitive Resistor matrix to an ESP8266 in order to read out and and wirelessly transmit the resistance values over WiFi with the MQTT protocol.
